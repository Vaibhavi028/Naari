<h1>Naari: Empowering Rural Women</h1>
<p>We developed a centralized platform named "Naari", which aimed at promoting the economic empowerment of women in rural parts of India. The platform's primary objective was to connect rural Indian women, particularly those involved in traditional crafts and practices, with potential investors, self-help groups, and organizations. As the frontend developer, I contributed to building a user-friendly interface that caters to the specific needs of our target audience.</p>
<p>The platform features online training modules to help women develop essential business and literacy skills, as well as a marketplace for them to showcase and sell their products. One of the platform's key highlights is the Success Stories section, which showcases inspiring narratives of women who have overcome adversity and achieved remarkable success through their dedication and hard work. This feature aims to inspire and motivate others to pursue their dreams and contribute to India's economic growth.</p>
